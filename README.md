## Testing User Stories from (UX) Section  
As a user, I want to be able to understand the business brand at a first look.

The welcome area on the hompage looks good on all devices. This is the main introduction to the brand and sets a nice tone for the business brand.

The menu has their own page. As well as a downloadable link in the footer which will download the entire menu
As a user, I want to be able to contact someone to place a food order or make a reservation.

The reservation form allows the user to select which day, time and how many people you would like to book for.
